                        Begin your tour with a short drive through Cozumel’s largest town, San Miguel, to see local houses, shops and modern-day residents, many of who are descendants of the area’s original Mayan inhabitants. Away from modern civilization and nestled in the jungle, San Gervasio was once the island’s center of culture and religion. Your certified guide will lead you through the archaeological site and share important facts, cultural histories and myths along the way. After returning to the bus, you will head off for a scenic drive along Cozumel’s beautiful East side. Away from the bustle of town, this nearly undeveloped coast is a side of the island that few visitors get to see and offers an idyllic landscape of white sand beaches, rugged rock formations, lush tropical vegetation and the iridescent waters of the Caribbean. Stop to enjoy one full hour to relax on the beach.
